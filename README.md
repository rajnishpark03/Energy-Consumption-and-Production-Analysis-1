# Energy-Consumption-and-Production-Analysis.

The goal of this project is to analyse global energy consumption and production patterns and develop a machine learning model to predict future energy consumption. By using historical data on various forms of energy consumption and production, the project aims to uncover insights that can inform energy policies and strategic planning. This will support sustainable energy use by providing a data-driven foundation for decision-making and policy development.

Objectives of the project:

•	Data Preparation and Cleaning: Collect and preprocess data from multiple sources to ensure consistency and accuracy.
•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct thorough EDA to understand historical trends, identify patterns, and uncover insights in energy consumption and production.
•	Feature Engineering: Select and engineer features that are most relevant for predicting energy consumption.
•	Model Development: Develop and train machine learning models to predict future energy consumption based on historical data.
•	Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics to ensure accuracy and reliability.
•	Insights and Recommendations: Provide insights derived from the data analysis and model predictions to inform policy and decision-making.

Conclusion:

This project aims to harness the power of data and machine learning to provide valuable insights into global energy consumption and production. By developing robust predictive models and uncovering key trends, the project will contribute to informed decision-making and strategic planning in the energy sector, ultimately supporting the transition to sustainable energy systems.
